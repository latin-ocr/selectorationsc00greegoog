THE ClTlZENSHIP OF ARCHIAS.

sc. 62. ’

THE case of ArchiaS, though not a public one, yet had its origin
in the politics of the time. The aristocratic fection, suspecting
that much of the strength of their opponents was derived from the
fraudulent votes of those who were not citizens, procured in rac. 65
the passage of the Lex Papia, by which “all the strangers, whopos-
sessed neither Roman nor Latin burgess·rights, were ejected from
the capital '' (Mommsen). Archias a native of Antioch‚ but for
many years a Roman citizen, a friend of Lucius Lucullus, was
accused in ac. 62, by a certain Gratius, under this laW, on the
ground that he was not a citizen. The case was tried before
the praetor Quintus Cicero, brother of the orator.

lt was a very small matter to disprove the charge, and com-
pletely establish Archias's claims to citizenship. The greater part
of the speech, therefore, is made up of an eulogy upon the poet,
and upon poetry and literature in general. lt is, for this reaso ‚
one of the mostag oreeable of Cicero’s orations, and perhaps tlh
greatest favorite of them all.
