IMPEA CHMEN T OF VERRES.

ac 70'.

Carus VERRES, a man of noble birth, but notorious lor his
crimes and exactions in the civil war and in the offices he had held
since, was city praetor (praetor urbanus) se. 74 At the close
of his term of office, he went, in accordance with the lau, as pro.-
praetor, to govern the province ol Sicily. By reason os the dis·
turbed condition of Italy, from the revolt ol Spartacus, he was not
relieved at the end of a year, as the law required, but continued

two years longer in the government ol the province, when he was ,

succeeded by Lucius Caecilius Metellus. During these three years
he was guilty of the most abominable oppressions aud exactions;

was afforded to Governor Eyre in England, on his return irom ’
Jamaica. Not only HortensiuS, but Curio, a manos excellent
reputation‚ with members of the eminent families of Scipio and
Metellus, stood tirmly byhim. The only hope of Verres was in
preventing a sair and speedy trial. First he tried to obtain a prose·
cutor who should be in collusion with him, and would not push him
too hard. For this purpose one Caecilius was put iorward, an in·
significant person, but a native of Sicily. Cicero’s first speech in
the case was therefore before the praetor Glabrio in person, toshow
that he, rather than Caecilius, should be allowed to conduct the
case. This it was not hard to du, and he set out at once lor Sicily
to collect evidence, for which purpose he was allowed one hundred
