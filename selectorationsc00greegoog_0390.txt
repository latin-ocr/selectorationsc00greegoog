ξ 16. Publio clodio: the name is given in full to emphasize the
person-tempori, the troubled time, which demanded the inves-
tigation-catoniez Μ. Porcius Cato (the Younger), a stern cham·
pion of the Senate, who, when Caesar had destroyed the hopes of
his party, killed himself at Utica,— hence called Uticensis—Dru-
eue: M. Livius Drusus (son of Marcus) was murdered by some
unknown person on returning home from an exciting political
debate (Β. c. 91).-A.iricano, i. e. AEmilianus. He was actively
opposed to the pians of C. Gracchus for the division of the Latian
lands; and, while the controversy was at its hottest, was found
dead in his bed, with marks (it was thought) of strangulation. His
wife, sister of the tribune, and Gracchus himself, lay under some
suspicion of the crime—quem immortalem, etc. Scipio died
at the age of fifty-six. — dolore, indrgnation.

ς 17. qula, etc„ i. e. it is question of persons—summorum,
infimorum, simply lugi and loro-intersit, grant a di erence
(hortat. subit-quidem, yet-monumentis, memorial: i. e.
the road itself. The Appian Way was constructed Β. c. 312, by
the censor Ap. Claudius Caecus, an ancestor of Clodius. This
circumstance is skilfully used to tell against Clodius, rather than
in his favor-ille, tlte famous.

ξ 18. Μ. Papirium: this was one oi Clodius's earliest exploits.
Papirius, a friend of Pompey, was killed in a brawl about a son of
Tigranes, held as hostage at Rome, whom Clodius was trying to
rescue and send back for a great ransom to Asia, having by a trick
got him out of the hands of his custodian.

177. templo castoris, where the Senate was then holding
session. The circumstance took place in the year of Clodius’s
tribunate (B. c. 58), while Pompey was in the Senate. “He in-
stantly went home and stayed there.'’-caruit, stayed away from.

§ 19. certe haec, surely all these, res, vir, tempus-summa,
in tlte highest degree-eo tempore, i. e. during the violences
which followed the exile of Cicero (see oration for Sestius). -— pro-
inde quani, just os iflico That is, the over! act must be judged
by its obvious intent: of course no tribunal (except an inquisition)
would attempt to try men for their intentioris (consilia).

§²0- adflictantur: this word refers to the outward signs of
violent grief, such as wringing the hands or bearing the breast.
This whole exaggerated description is probably in lively contrast
with the fact.

178. 5 21. ferendam, to be proposed to the people. -reoon-
olllatae: Pompey had lately renewed friendly relations with Clo-
dius-fortiter, firmor-delegit: the choice of the iudices was
lett to Pompey, as the Senate had decreed it to be left to the praetor
in the trial of Clodius (see note,§13).-secrevit, set ostile.-
