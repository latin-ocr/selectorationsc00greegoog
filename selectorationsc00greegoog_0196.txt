DEFENCE OF MILO.

ac. 52.

, Dumna the absence of Caesar in Gaul, and after the disastrous
campaign of Crassus in the East (Β. c. 54), Pompey remained in
Rome, with an influente which would have amounted to absolute
power, if he had been a man⁴ of more political sagacity‚ and had
known his own mind better. The real leader of the popular party
at this time was Clodius,a man of versatile and brilliant gifts, of
high birth hut infamous life, a bitter and unscrupulous partisan in
politics; while, after the death of Crassus, the unnatural coalition
was dissolved, and Pompey drifted easily into the ranks of the oli-
