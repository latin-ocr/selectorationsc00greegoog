hope sor the republic. Each endeavored to secure the countenance
oi the Senate‚ and to gain control over the public armies; and
each succeeded in attaching to himself a considerable force, while
neither was strong enough to hold the capital against the other.

Meanwhile Cicero, who at first hailed the death of Caesar as the
restoration of the republic, lost courage, and set out iu July for
Greece. Detained, however, by contrary winds‚ and receiving
more favorable news from Rome, he returned to the city at the end
of August, to lind that all his hopes were void. Still, he made au
