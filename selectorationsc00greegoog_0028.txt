CICERO'S SELECT ORATIONS. ·

DEFENCE OF ROSCIUS.

nc. 80.

Sensus Roscrus was a rich and respected citizen of Ameriae
town (municipium) of Umbria, about fifty miles north of Rome.
He had a taste sor city life, and spent most of his time at Rome,
where he was ou intimate terms with some of the highest families,
especially the Metelli and Scipios. Meantime his son Sextus, who
certainly laclred his father's cultivated tastes‚ and was accused by
his enemies os rudeness and clownishuess‚ had the care of the
extensive family estates at Ameria.

Sometime during the dictatorship os Sulla—probably in the
autumn of 81 B.c.‚ -the elder Roscius was murdered one evening
as he was returning from a dinner party! The murder was no
doubt procured, or at least connived at, by one Titus Roscius
Magnus, his fellow·townsman and enemy. However that may be,
the name ol the murdered man was put upon the proscriptionlist
by Chrysogonus, a freedman and favorite of Sulla, who bought his
confiscated estates at auction ata nominal price. Three of these
estates (there were thirteen in all) he transferred toa certain Titus
Roscius Capito, another townsman and enemy of the deceased, and
a leading man at Ameria; the remainder he put in charge os
Magnus as his agent The younger Sextus, a man of sorty, thus
robbed os his patrimony‚ had recourse to his father's friends in
Rome sor protection and help 3 when the three conspirators, fearing
that they might be compelled to disgorge, resolved to secure them-
selves byaccusing him of his father’s murder. This they did through
aprol'essional prosecutor (accusator) named Erucius, who undertook
the legal formalities os the prosecution.

The aristocratic friends of Roscius, not daring to brave the
creature ol' the dictator, but not wishing to leave their guest-friend
