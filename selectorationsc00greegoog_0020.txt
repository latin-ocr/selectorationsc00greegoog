Life qs Cicero. xr

eminent merits, partly by the wave of moderate relbrm,
into the consulship (Β. e. 63), at the age of sowy-three.

Cicero was now at the highest point of his success and
fame, the recognized head of a moderate party, which
aimed to preserve the old institutione of the State, while
tempering them with a more liberal policy. But he lacked
the qualities of a successful political leader. He was vain,
hesitating, lacking sels-control, decision, and dignity of
character. As a “new man,’' he never had the full confi·

his last protest against the reign of force that daily became
more imminent in Rome. The two following years he
served as Proconsul in Cilicia, and returned, with the com·
plimentary title of imperator, to lind all things ripe for civil
war. Pompey, both because he hated Caesar, and because
there was no one else to ¹take the place, drilied into the
position of leader and general of the conservative party.
