The former edition was designed to give a complete review of
Latin Syntax‚ commencing with Indirect Discourse‚ and illustrated
by examples selected from tlte classical writers (chiefly Cicero), each
written exercise being introduced by easy sentences for Oral Prac-
tice, and accompanied with full references to the Grammar. ln this
form it found constant and extensive use for nearly ten years, when
it appeared desirable to issue an edition thoroughly revised, cx·
panded in all its parts, and preceded by hessons on Elementary
Constructions. In accordance with this design‚ the original [essoris
have been (in part) re-arranged‚ and the introductory and gram·
