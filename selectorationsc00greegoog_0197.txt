170 Desence of Milo. [M1L0‚

tavem by the wayside. Here Milo, not to leave so dangerous an
enemy alive, followed him up; and Clodius with a dozen others, ³
including the owner of the tavern‚ was killed, The meeting was
probably accidental on both sides. But each had openly threatened ἦ
the other’s life: each party violently charged the other with pre·

meditated assault, and actual or intended murder. Anarchy broke
loose in Rome, The funeral of Clodius was an occasion of riot
and conflagration. Other disorders followed. Quiet was only re·
stored at last by the appointment of Pompey as “ consul without
colleague,’' who for about six months held the city under a sort of
martial law.

A special court was organized early in the year, to try all cases
arising out of the brawl in the Appian Way. The trial of Milo,
before this court, on the charge of assault and homicide, took place
about the'1oth of April. Cicero undertordc his defence both from
political motives and from personal regard. The court was guarded
by armed troops-a strange sight then in Rome—from the vio-
lence of the mob which raged outside. Cicero, whose nerves were
ν . shaken by the uproar, lost his sels-command, and spoke “not with
his usual firmness.” Milo was condemned by thirty-eight votes ³
out of fifty-one, and went into exile at Marseilles. Cicero, dissatis-
fied with the speech actually delivered, as taken down by short-hand, ¹
wrote ¹out at his leisure the master-piece of eloquence and specious
argument which follows.
