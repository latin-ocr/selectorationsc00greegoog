THE PARDON OF MARCELL US.
n. c. 46.

Marcus Cunuorus Mnncsrcus (consul s. c. 51) had beenan
honest but active and bitter partisan of the Senate in the struggle
which finally broke out in civil war. lt was he who introduced the
several decrees which set a limit to Caesar's power, and put him in
the attitude of a public enemy After the defeat at Pharsalia, and
the death of Pompey, he still refused to make terms with the vic·
tor, but remained in voluntary exile at Mitylene. When, contrary ¹
to the general sear, no massacre or proscription followed Caesar’s
victory, his friends were encouraged to hope for a full pardon; l
and, in the summer of Β. c. 46, in a meeting of the Senate, Caesar
was openly entreated in his behalf. In reply‚ the dictator reminded
the senators of the intense and persistent hostility of Marcellus; ,
but added, that he would not stand in the way if the Senate desired
his restoration. The senators were then, in regular form, called up
for the expression of their wishes; and, when it came to Cicero's
name, he expressed the formal thanks of the body in the following
speech. lt is remarkable— especially in contrast'to the language
which Cicero used two years later - for the tone of its eulogy of
Caesar, and sor the hope it expresses of an era of good feeling aud
a restored republic.

Marcellus set out for Rome, but never arrived. He was assas-
sinated at the Piraeus, and buried in the Academy near Athens.
