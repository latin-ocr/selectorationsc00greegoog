Paos

2. ξ 1. Credo . . . pericnlum vitant This paragraph may be
analyzed as an example of the involved periodic style of Latin
writers. 'l’he main clause is credo ego; the rest of the sentence,
is all the object of oredo in the intlirect discourse (ξ 336).* The
main verb os the discourse is mirari (changed stom mnamlni).

⁴ The references are to the sections of Allen and Greenongh's Latin Grammar.
