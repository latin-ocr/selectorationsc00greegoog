4. Sentence of the Conspirators.

Io the senate, Dec. 5.

Two days liter the Senate was convened, to determine what was

to be done with the prisoners. It was a fundamental principle ot

the Roman Constitution that no citizen should be put to death

without the right of appeal to the people. Against the view of

Caesar, which favored perpetual confinement, Cicero urged the

very lame argument that, by the fact of taking up arms against the

Republic, they had forfeited their citizenship, and the law therefore

did not protect them. This view prevailed, and the conspirators

-Lentulus, Cethegus Statilius, Gabinius, and Caeparius-were ,

strangled by the public executioners. ¹
This was one of those acts of excessive vigor and severity which

aman who feels himself deficient in decision of character—as
Cicero was, at bottom-—will sometimes force himself to commit„
Had he had the strength to maintain himself as a leader in public
affairs, it need not have hurt him in the end. As it was, he was

soon pushed aside by men of genuine executive power, Pompey
and Caesar, and was made to suffer severely for his illegal act. ἦ

dum modo meis laboribus vobis populoque Romano
