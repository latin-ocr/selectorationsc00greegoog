from Causinius's testimony, that he had spent that night athis

ξ 52. nihil umquam, etc. On the contrary, Cicero says else-
where (Att. IV. 3), speaking of the disorder that followed his
return from exile, “If he [Clodius] comes in his way, 1 foresee
that he will be killed by Milo. He does not hesitate to do it; he
