NOTE.

‘ Ture Selection follows strictly the text oi Banna and Karsra as

a new textus receptas, even when the editors would personally prefer

adiilerent reading. They have, however, rejected the double r'in
the genitive oi the second declension, which must have been un-
known to Cicero.

The orations ior Roscius and sor Sestius are considernbl y abridged‚
on account oi their length and some special difficulties. They are
inserted sor their exceptional importanoe in reference to the orator’s
career, and they are especially recommended to students ior that
reason. Teachers will find great advantage in using such parta
as are not necessary in the regular school course, as exercises
in reading at sight-rt practice which cannot he too highly

recommended, and ior which the shorter selectione are more

particularly intended.
