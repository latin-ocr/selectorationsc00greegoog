gularity ol the proceeding by which Clodius, a man or' sorty, was
adopted as son bya youth of twenty. The correct legal term is
transitio.

A patricias who wished to hold the plebeian office or* tribune, which was the preat
engine ot' portica] power, might malsc a formal renunciation of the privileges ot' his rank:
in this case, being no longera patrician, he of course belonged to the commonalty, or
plebs. This was called transitio adstarem (Momm¹ Rdm. Forsch· i p. 124), and the sor·
mal act by wh'ch it took place wascalled detestatio sacrorum (renunciation οἱ the sacred
rites). Clodius attempted this simple process n. c. oo, but was prohibited sor some reason
by the consul, Metellus Celer, and the next year because a member os the plebe by adoption
