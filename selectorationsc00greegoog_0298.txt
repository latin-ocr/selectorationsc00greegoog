Sensi-omn Otiose. - Strictly speiking the Ordo Senatorio was only another name
for the Senate, the members of which, by virtue of their li e tenure oi office. attd their
rsprit decerpe, forrned a united body or ⁶· order ¹’ in the state. 'l'he list of senators
amnunting m general to about gno, was formerly mide up bt tlte Consors from among those
who had held high magsracies: atter the time of Sula every person who held the quaes·
torship-the first grade of the regular nragistracy (see note ξ ir) -was entitled to a seat
in the Senate. 'l'he number therefore fluctuated. running up to five or six hundred. The
electione were so largely under tlte control of the Senate and the magistrates. that it war

very hard for any person not belonging to the nobilitylsee note on l syl io be chosen to any
office: when any such person, novur homo, entered the Senate, -suclt as Cato the Censor,

Marius and Cicero, -he be'onged of course to the Senatorial order, although he was not
ι noble, such mes, however, were so rare, that it may be laid down as a general truth,
that the Senatorial order and the Nobility were identicat. and ¹¹new men ’¹ became ne·
cessarily identified with tlte class to which their poneriiy would belong, rather than that
from which they came. This double relation of Cicero-³ member of the Scorto, but
sprung from the Equestrian order-goes a great way l⁰ “phin what is inconsistent and
vacillating in his political career.

Eonesrnrnn Oronti. -The title Epat'ter was properly applied tu the members of the
eighteen centuries equitum equo peslero: to whom a horse was assigned by the state,
together with a certain sum of money yearly for its support. Those who served aquo pub·
lico must have a fortune of eodooo sesterces (dromon), and the horses were assigned by
the censore, as a ruis, to the young men of senatorial families. The centurt'ae eqnt'fum were
therefore composed of young nob'emen. [see“Celsi Ramn0s‚” Hor Α. Ρ. ν 3⁴²1· When
they entered the Senate, they were tin the later years of the republic) obliged to give np the
public horse: on becoming senators therefore they voted in thecenturiesof the first class.
notwith the Equites (see note on Assemblies, ξ ι8). This aristocratic body had. how·
ever, long before this period, ceased to serve in the field: they formed a parade corps (some-
' what like the Royal Gnards in Englandl. from which active offioers of the legion, tributii.
were taken. When the Roman epur'trr ceased to serve as cavalry, troops of horse were de·
manded of the allies; and in the time of Casar we find that the Roman legion consisted
exclusively of infantry, the cavalry being made np of auxiliaries.

During the time that the equites equo pvblt'co still served in the field as cavalry, another
body grew up by their side. of equites equo privato, tliat is, persons of tlte equestrian
census, who had a property of rooooo sesterces, who had not received a horse from the
state, but who volunteered with horses of their own. This body consisted mainly of young
men of werith, who did not belong to noble (that is, senatorial) families. No very distinct
line was, however. drawn between the two classes. until the Lex Jnds'crhria of Caius Grac·
chus fo c. 123), which prescribed that the judices should no longer be taken from the
senators, but from those who possessed equestrian census, and at the same time were not
reembers of the Senate (see note onjudr‘ces, R. Α. 5 1). 'l'his law did not fonnalty exclude
nobles who were not members of the Senate: bnt the entire body of nobility was so far
identified in spirit and interest with this body. that an antagonism immediately grew up
· between them and this new jndicial class. Α principat cause of the antagonism was that
mosibus of the Senate were prohibited from being engaged in any trade or business ς while,
as hasbeen shown above. the Senate. by its control over the electione, virtually filled its
own vacancies, of course from the ranks of the nobility.

Since rich men of non-senatorial familias were thus excluded from apolitical career,
while Senators were excluded from a business tite, there were formed during the last century
of the republic two powerfnl aristomedes. -the nobles, or Senatorial order, a wealthy gov-
erning aristocracy of ranlr. and the Equestrian order. an aristocracy of wealth‚ the
connterpart of the moneyed aristocracyof our day. The name Ordo Equestris was derived
from the fact of its members possessing the equestrian census: that is. that amount of
property which would have entitled them to a public horse. From tlte ranlrs of the nobility ⁴
were talten tlte oppressive provincial governors: the equestrian order furnished the publi-
renr'. the equally oppressivc tax-gatherers. It is easy to see. therefore, that neither the law
of Gracchus, which placed the Court of'Repetundae in the exclusive power of tlte Eques·
trian order. nor that of Sulla, which gave it to the Senators exclusively, was calculated to
orotset the provinciale against extortion¹
