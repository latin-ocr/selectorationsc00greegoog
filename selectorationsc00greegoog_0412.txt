§ 17. de nullo elio, ete: i. e. why he selected Ligarius out
of all Pompey’s followers; how one who had committed precisely

227, ξ 18. monuue, “in hisgrave.” -oontumeltamz Caesar’s
proconsular command in Gaul ended March 1, n. c. 49. lt was
usual in such cases to continue in command until the next first
of January‚ on the principle that every tenure of office continued
until a successor was appointed, and, in consequence of a law
of Sulla, the consuls and praetors went to the government of
provinces immediately on the expiration of their term of office in
the city. Α new law of Pompey's, however, had provided that
live years, should intervene between the magistracy and the gov-
ernorship, so that'it would be easy to appoint a successor to Caesar
at the legal expiration of his office. Further‚ Caesar had been
exempted by law from the necessity of presenting himself in per·
son as a candidate for the consulship of Β. c. 48. His plan was to
he elected in his absence, to retain his proconsulship until the day
when he should assume the consulship again, and thus to have no
gap between the two offices If there were a gap of a single day,
his enemies were on the watch to prosecute him, for various acts
which were at any rate irregular. Their policy was to abrogate
his command, if possible, and at any rate to repeal the law which
allowed him to be a candidate while absent. The year 50 ne.
was consumcd in fruitless negotiatione and attempts at compro-
mise3 when Pompey and the Senate at last cut off further de-
hate, refused all concessions to Caesar, and declared war. lt
was this treatment which Cicero describes as contumelia-pa-
oem esee cupiebas: it seems certain that Caesar had, in his
desire for peace, carried his offers of compromise as far as was
possible-nt tibi conveniret. that you should come to an un-

clerstondr'rrg (in appos. with id).
