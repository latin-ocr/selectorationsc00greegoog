POMPEY’S MILITARY COMMAND.

(For the Mrnz'lr'cm Low.)
sc. 66.

THE last serious resistance made to the Roman power in the
East was by Mithridates VI., king ol Pontus, whose dominions
embraced the whole eastern coast of the Black Sea (Pontus Euxi-
nus), including the kingdom of Bosporus (Crimea) on the one hand,
and Paphlagonia on the other; while the king ol Armenia was
closely allied to him by marriage. He was the most formidable
enemy encountered by Rome after Hannibal, and there were three
several wars between them. The first was conducted by Sulla (rac.
88-84), who gained great successeS, and obliged Mithridates to pay

Gabinius, one ol the most active demagogues ol the time. Another
law, proposed by the same politician, required the Senate to appoint
a commender ol consular rank, with extraordinary powers for
three years, by land and sea, to suppress the piracy which infested
every part of the Mediterranean, having its chief seat in Cilicia
It was understood as a matter oi course that Gnaeus (or Cneius)
Pompey, who had been living in retirement since his consulship,
uc. 70, would receive this appointment. Pompey accomplished his
task with the most brilliant success, and in three months had the
seas completely cleared. (See beloW, chap. ΧΗ.)

Meantime Glabrio had shown himself wholly incompetent to con-
