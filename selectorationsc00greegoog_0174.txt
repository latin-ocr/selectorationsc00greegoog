CICERO'S EXILE ANJ) RETURN.

(Extract from the Desertae of Sestius.)
nc. 56

Tne· year B. c. 60 is marked by the coalition between Caesar,
Pompey, and Crassus, - sometimes called the First Triumuirate, ·-
of which the immediate result was the election of Caesar to the
consulship for the following year. During the existence of this
coaliti0u‚ the Senate was almost wholly stripped of power. The
chief actos Caesar's administration was his iniquitous law for
dividing the fertile and populous territory of Campania among
needy citizens of Rome; which was carried with such a degree of

consuls, Gabinius and Piso, refused to interfere. Pompey would
not meet or see his eloquent advocate. Caesar, just departing for

into voluntary exile, which was followed, the next day, by a decree
(przbilegz'um) forbidding him by name the use of fire or water
