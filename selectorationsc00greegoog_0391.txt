menta maxima: in his praetorship (n c 58), Domitius had

any other carme, they still held ior a lull year, and thus this irregular commencement d
the official year became its regular cornmencement. strewarde the date oi the official
year was ixed, and any interneciuum was deducted irom the time oi the actual magis·
imtes. Thus, e. α 53, the magistrates were not elected until July, and could therefore
hold office only until January, less than six months.
