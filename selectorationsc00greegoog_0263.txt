236 Tne Struggle against Antony. [Pnu- XIV.

Bononia, while Pansa’s late was unknown, that Cicero, in the
Senate, delivered his sourteenth and last Philippic.

The rejoicings were soon at an end. Octavianus found that his
own interests were best served by uniting with Antony against the
Senate. These two - with Lepidus as a third triumvir-came
easily into possession os supreme power. A remorseless proscrip
tion followed, in which the most illustrious victim was Cicero, sac-
rificed to Antony's resentment, the vindictive hate oi Fulvia, and
the cold ingratitudo of Octavianus.

Ol the sourteen Philippics, the Second is by lar the most famous.
lt isa long and elaborate invective, -in some parts' exceedingly
bitter and coarse, - reviewing the domestic and political career of
Mari< Antony, charging him with every personal vice and almost
every public crime. ln its allusions to the public acts of Cae-
sar, its hostility is uncompromising, vindictive, often scornful.
The revival of the title “perpetual dictator '² seems to have inspired
Cicero with hatred‚ horror, and sear; and his real hostility was no
longer disguised aster Caesar's death. This oration contains the
celebrated portiait of him, interesting as the only extant testimony,
puhlicly spoken at the time, os one who was at once contemporary,
peer, and rival ε -

Fuit in illo ingenium, ratio, memoria, littera, cura, cogitatio,
diligentia. Res bello gesserat, quamvis reipublice calamitosas, at
tamen magnas. Multos annos regnare meditatus, magno labore,
maltis periculis, qnod cogitarat ffeerat. Muneribus, monimen·
tis, congiariis, epulis multitudinem imperitam delenierat: suas
praemiis, adversarios clementia specie devinxerat. Quid multa?
attulerat jam libera civitati, partim metu partim patientia, consuc-
tudinem serviendi. Sed ex plurimis malis, qua ab illo rel publica
sunt inusta, lzoc tamen boni est, qnod didicit jam populusRomanus
quantum curant crederet, quibus se committeret, a qur'bus caveret.

The Fourteenth Philippic hasa unique interest as the last free
voice oi the Roman Senatc, and from its ill-timed confidence in the
future emperor. lt is also interesting as an example oi labored and
stately panegyric on patriots fallen in battle, aiter the manner of the
Greeks, and from the formal resolution oi thanlrs and honor with
which it closes. Its immediate occasion was a resolution of P.
Servilius, that the citizens should lay aside the military garb‚ and
that a public thanksgiving should be celebrated in honor ol the

ictory. ·
