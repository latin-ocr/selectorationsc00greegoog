he had once really set out—nugarum nihilne nonscnse, such

communem, tlte irnpartiality of Mm -pranei: the prandium
was the noon-day meai, generally quite simple, of fruit and breed.-
baeslt, was caught-expetiverunt: this illustrates the ancient
mode of regarding punishment, as a compensation exacted from
the wrong-doer by the person injured. (See Maine, “Antient
Law‚” n· ³58)

ς 57. manu misit: only slaves could bo forced to give testi-
mony by torture (R. A. § 35). As Milo had freed his, it was
claimed that he wished to destroy evidence. Manumission under
such circumstances was forbidden by later law. - ln cauea, on tlte

192, ς 59, quaestiones, examinatam (by turture) os Clodius's
slaves-in atrio Libertatis. It was in this hall (probably near
the present Column ol Trajan) that questions touching the libera-
tion of slaves were considered, and that torture‘ was inflicted,-
not merely in mockery of the name, but to excite in the slave some
hope of {medon-Appius: son of C. Claudius, an elder brother
of Clodius. —de servis: the passage in brackets seems necessary
to the sense. The exception de incestu—not the only exception,
by the way-is mentioned to bring the jest upon Clodius (com-
pare note, Cat. 111. § 9). - proxime, very near: i. e. by having
his murder treated as sacrilege, in respect to the question of slaves.
(The whole passage is an argument a fortiori. lf the Romans
excluded enforced testimony ol a master’s slaves when the truth
could be arrived at, how much more should it be excluded here,
where the truth was impossible on account of the templatim.)-
ad ipsos, in the mysteries of the Bona Dea (see§ 13). In the very
effective sarcasm of this passage, there is a pardonable confusion
between the qaeestio in dominum ¹(sor incest by Clodius), and the
