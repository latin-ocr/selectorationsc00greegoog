THE saracena Acnrwsr Awrowr.

u. c. 43.
Juttus CAEsAR was assassinated on the ldes of March (March

. 15), Β. c. 44, by a band of conspirators, headed by Marcus Junius

Brutus and Caius Cassius Longinus. The conspirators sancied that
if the dictator were out of the way the Republic could be restored.
But the success of Caesar had made any return to the republic
impossible. Nor had the conspirators made any provision sor
their own saiety‚ much less ior getting control oi the government

The only question was, who should succeed to the power os the Ἰ

murdered dictator. And the only persons who had any, chance of
doing so were Mark Antony, Caesar's surviving colleague in the

appointed by Caesar to succeed· him as consul, and assumed the
office at his death. I·le dallied with the conspirators, suppressed
the violence of the mob that threatened them, and might have had
some pretensions to the power, with the support of the aristocracy,
but was easily outgeneralled or bought off by Antony. Lepidus,
who had a military command, and in whom the aristocracy had some
hope, was also gained over by Antony. Octavianus, now twenty
years old, hastened srom Epirus to claim his inheritance‚ and take
part in the conflict which he saw approaching. lle was a young
man of precocious talem, of cool and wary temper, of ambition
equal to Antony's‚ and ofa political sagacity which, through his
long life, seems never to have been at fault.

Neither of the two chief claimants was strong enough alone to
be quite independent of the other; though at first they stood in the
