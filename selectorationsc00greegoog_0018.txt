LIFE OF CICERO.

———-

Mantus Turnus Cicero ranks as the first prose writer
in Roman literature, and in fame as the second orator of the
world. His public life, lasting nearly forty years, covers
the entire period from Sulla's dictatorship to the fall of the
Republic3 and for all this time his orations are by far the
most important and interesting documents that exist. '

The events of Cicero's life, so far as they are necessary
Ι to an understanding of his career as orator and statesman,
are these. He was born B. c. 106-the same year with
Pompey, and six years before Julius Caesar- at Arpinum,
a town in the Volscian territory, about fifty miles east of
Rome, the birthplace also of Caius Marius. His father, a
wealthy citizen of equestrian rank, removed to the capital
in order to give his sons, Marcus and Quintus, the best
education possible. Here the young Cicero studied law
with the great jurist, Quintus Mucius Scaevola, the augur,
⁰ and, after his death, with his yet more distinguished kins-
man of the same name3 and was intimate with the eminent
orators Lucius Licinius Crassus and Marcus Antonius,
grandfather of tbe triumvir. He studied rhetoric and phi·
losophy with 'the best Greek teachers; and from the poet
Archias in particular, whom he afterwards defended in one
of his most gracefnl orations, he derived that taste for
literature which distinguished him among all the public
men of his day.

Cicero arrived at manhood just at the time when the
fearful civil convulsions were beginning, which ended only
with the overthrow of the Republic. He served a short
campaign in the Social War (Β. c. 89); but remained in
obscurity through the horrors of the civil war that followed,
