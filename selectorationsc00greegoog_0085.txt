58 Pompey’s llfr’lr’tary Command. [MANHn

posed a law extending Pompey’s command over the entire East.
Power like this was quite inconsistent with the republican institu-
tions of Rome, and with the established authority of the Senate; ²
the law was of course opposed hythe leaders of the aristocracy
(optzinatcs), led by Hortensius and Catulus. Cicero was now prae-
tor. lle was no democrat of the school of Gabinius and Caesar ;
on the other hand he had no hereditary sympathies with the Sen-
ate, and he probably failed to recognize the revolutionary character
of the proposition, but considered merely its practical advantages:
he therefore supported it with ardor. This was his first political
speech. Before this time he had been a public-spirited lawyer; from
this time on he was essentially a politician, and it is not hard to see
how unfavorably his character was influenced by contact with the
corrupt politics of that day.

The Manilian Law was passed, and Pompey fulfilled the most
sanguine expectations of his friends. He brought the Mithridatio
War to an end, organized the Roman power throughout the East
and returned home ac. 61, with greater prestige and glory tlian had

ever been reached by any Roman before him. μή Μ Ι ¹.
