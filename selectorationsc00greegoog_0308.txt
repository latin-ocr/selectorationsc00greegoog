were estab'ishetl hy Sulla in honor of his victory. The Ludi Pledea'r' (Nor. μα’ 17) were
established in the time ot the dissensionsof the orders early iu the Republiqin inritatio!
ot tue Ludi Magni or Romani, aud were presided over by the plebeian aediles.

perpauci: the month of December was full of festivals-retu
integram, i. e. from the beginning. The points of the prosecution
would have been forgotten, the public interest would have cooled
down, and the jury would be almost wholly new. The case must
therefore be taken up da aava.

§32 nunc, opposed to ai diffisus essem, above-iurato,
ort oatlt. The judaeos were on oath; the prator, not. Metellus
might therefore be trusted to vote honestly as juror, but not to pre-
side impartially. -legitimo tempore: he had aright to use twenty
days for developing the points of the prosecution.

5 33. perpetua oratione, a conta'ataoas argument, before bring·
ing up tlte witnesses. This is what we possess in the five speeches
of the Accusatio, which, in the usual order of proceeding, would
have been delivered before bringing up the witnesseS, but which were
never delivered at all-percipi, reapad: the regular term for
gathering crepe—potuit, might aava baan.-—publieie‚ official,
i. e. of ciues-tabulis, records‚· auctoritatibus, documenta-
rea omnis. Here, before stating his plan, Cicero goes off on an-
other digression against Hortensius, which shows clearly one of
his principal motives in undertaking the prosecution—-diluendl,
rafutt'ng (washing off ).

36. explicandis, ansoldirtg.-nune, as itis--ex tua na-
tura: Hortensius, like M. Metellus was personally an amiable and
bonorable man, though pledged to a bad cause. —malltioae, in bad
saith-rationi, scheme, looking to the means; oonsilio, plan,
looking to the end. Cicero contrasts them more than once.

ξ 34. binos ludos, i. e. Pompey’s games and the Roman.-
comperendinata, arthoaro ovar a day (perendie).

After opening the ease (as in the present speech), the usual course was ior the prose
tutor to present his proofs and arguments in a connected speech, or seriesof speeches (per-
petua oraro), to which the oeunset for the defence could artswer, and tlten tlte witnesses
would be brought hrward. The case was now really complete: but it was required at this
point comperendinare, 't e· adjourn over the second day, in order to ntalte sure that the
Α chain of evidence uas complete. For this actio seruam, as it was properly called. every
short time only was necessary. The comperendinatio was therefore a sign that the trial
was near its close. Cicero's determination to bring this about before Pompey's gemes-2
i. e. within ten days- settled the case in his favor: for, as has been shown, the only hopt
os the desence lay iu putriug ott the trial.

necesarium, unavoidable .· id 'refers to eoa velle. eto-amplum
et preclarum, honoranti distz‘nction.'— perieulum, trial (from
the same root found in experior).'-tnnoeenttae, purity os ad·
ministratton in Sicily: an almost technical word for using with

moderatiori the immense power in the hands of a Roman officiat,
iu the provinces.
