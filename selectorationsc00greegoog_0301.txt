θῇ. ξ rr. adulescentiae, i. e. before he entered public life.-
quaestura, qrroeslorslu'p, the first grade of political honor.

'l'he quae tors were at this time twenty in number, two having charge of the treasury

and archives in the city, while the others were assigned ιο the several military commandere ¹

and provincial governors. to serve asqnartermasters and paymasters. Aspirants for bonore
were required ιο serve as qrraestors before presenting themselves for the praetorship, which
was, again. a requirement for the consulship. The office of curule :edile was regularly
held-eas by Cicero -between the quaestorship and praetotship. That this was not neca-
sary, however. as is often assumed, is proved by the fact that there were six praetors, but
only two curule ediles. (See Mommsen Rom. saeerecht, vol. i. p 443.)

Carbonem: Carbo was the leader of the Marian fection after

the death of Marius and Cinna. He was consultae. 82, the year ¹

of Sulla's return and victory. Verres was his quaestor, and went

over to the enemy with the money-obest, when he saw which side l
was likely to premii-necessitudinem religionemque: the t

quaestor was originally nominated specially ογ the consul ; and the
peculiarly close and sacred relation (necessitudo) existingberween
them was known as pratae—a sentiment of filial affection. (See
Lange, Rom. Alt. vol. i. p. 633.) The designation by lot (sors)
was also held to be a token of divine will, and so sacred (religio).
——legatioz the legatus, or aad was a member of the general’s staff,
and stood in something of the same 'relation to him as the quaestor.

Verres, as legatus, served Dolabella much as he had served Carbo: ἶ

not that either of those infamous commandere deserved better

treatment. -Asiae: the province of this name, the old kingdom of γ
Pergamus, embraced the western part of Asia Minor. The prov·

ince of Dolabella (s. c. 80-79) was Cilicia. His extortions and ,

those of Verres were in the adjoining regions of Pamphylia, Pisidia,

’ and parts of Asia. The word totius is therefore arbetorical err-

aggeration.

The term provincia was primarily used to designate the special field of operatione as-
signed (by lot, agreement, or designation of the Senate) to a consul or other military oom-
mander. When ι foreign territory was conquered and reduced ιο a subjection to Rome,
the govemment of it was assigned to one of the praetors, or the imperium of a consul or
pretor was extended (prorogatum) for a oecond year for this purpose. The foreign state
thus organized as a Roman dependeney was called hythe old name prwrwciu and this
special use of theword is more familiar in dassicnaiters than its original meaning. Of the
states here mentioned, Asia was arr organized province, while Cilicia, Pisidia, and Pam-
phylia were provinces only in the early sense of the words Cilicia, however, was the regular
provincia, or special command. of a propretor, whose field of openiens was western
Cilicia (Cilicia Aspera), with the adjoining coast-line of Pamphylia, and mountain region of
Pisidia. - Cilicia was not formaily organized as a province until s. c. 75. As governor of
aprovince in the later sense of the word, the pro-praetor exercised direct rnle only over
those portione of the country which had been subjugated ογ Rome, while the geogmphicel
limits of his province enclosed also allied and independent communities, ceinessociae
and libera (see Kuhn, Verfassung des Rem. Reich. vol. ii. p. 14); some of which paid
tribute, while others were tribute-free, immunes, as well as legally exempt from his an·
tlrority in matters of administration. Pracrically, however, even these last were unda· his
almost n'nlimited control.
