provincial quaestorship, the commender might appotnt any person
to perform its fonctions. (Mommsen, tt. S. vol. i. p. 187).—adduxit:
Dolabella was bad enough, buthe had to bear the added infamy of
Verres’ outrageous acts, and after all Verres saved himself by turn-
ing against him (oppugnavit), appearing as witness in his trial for
extortion.

ξ 12. praetura urbana: this is the topicos the first oration of
the accusatio.

There were at this time eight praetore, whose office it was to preside over the adminis-
tration of justice; after the expiration of their year of office, they went as pro-pretores to
goveni provinces. Verres held the tirst and most important of tlte praetorships, that of
prator urbanus, who had the charge of civil ceses between Roman citizens; the prator
peregrinus had civil cases in which aliens were a party: the other six presided over tlte
Quaestims perpetua. 'l'he praetor urbanus, having charge of all civil cases between
citizens, had almost unlimited power of plunder, and this was used by Verres without
scruple. His colleague, tlte prator peregrinus, tilled several books with cases in which he
interceded, in order to oblige Verres to administer justice in accordance with his own
rules. The fonctions of the praetor were summed ttp in these words tto (sudem, vindi-
ciae), orco (jar), nnntco (rem, etc.).'

the aedile, not of the praetor: the cases referred to here were, there-

contracts for public buildings in which the praetor had it in his
power to interfere for his own advantage. -ln jnre dicundo ; jus

the praet0r3 bonorum addictio is the adjudging of property to the
claimant; condonatio (grant) is the giving it up to the defendant:

law, not absolutely binding, however, for their successors. -poeee,

513. senatus consulta, decrers (or executive orders) of tlte
Senate.

The Senate had originally only advisory powers. tt had therefore, strictly speaking,
no authority to make laws or to enforce their execution ς and its votes were simply consul·
ta, ἰ. e. matters agreed upon, as advisable. while its power was auroram. When the
Senate cante (in the 3d cent. a. e.) to be the actual governing power in the State, these
consalta became ordinaturos, in which tlte Senate directed tlte administration of the whole
empire. The organization of anew province, e. g.‚ was not bya law of the people‚ bnt byan ,
ordinante ol the Senate; and in this ordinance was embodied the entire authority ot Rome
over the province, except so far ae this was prescribed by general laws. This ruas leges
