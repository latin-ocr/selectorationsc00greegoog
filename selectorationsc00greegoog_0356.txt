ἔψη] Catilina III. 77

ξ 18. qnod . . . ,potuum (parenthetical), because, &c -oonrssl
limits gubernatio in the predicate: to betortg to huncum masclam
turn (below) answers to cum. -faces, etc: these omens are such
as the Romans observed and noted caret'ully. Livy’s history is lull
of then-praetermittendum, inadvertently; relinquendum, in-
tentionall.

§ ro Cyotta et nosquam, consuls Β. c. 65, the year in which
Catiline's conspiracy was first intended to break nut-aera: the
laws were engraved ou bronze tables. Some of these are still err·
tant-iila...Romulu⁸: it is disputed whether this was the
bronze statue of the wolf sucldiug the infants, which is now in
. the Capitoline Museum at Rome, and which bears marks either
of lightning scaming one of its hind legs, or ol some deiect in
the casting. Mommsen (Vol. l. p. 608) holds it to be the same.-
flexlaseut: in dir. disc. flexerint, following appropinquare, which
has a future sense.

ς 20.· illocalia, the haruspices. —ldern (plum), they also.

118. contu atque, opposite to what (ξ r 56. a). -solia . . .
conspiceret: this is one oi the most conclusive passages in sup-
port of the view that the Capitolium, or Temple of Jupiter Capi-
tolinus, was on the south-western point of the hill. A statue here,
facing east, would also face (conspiceret) the forum and comitium,
which would not be the case with one upon the north-eastern point.
-conlooandurn locaverunt: the regular expression for giving
out a contract (ξ 294. d). -llli, of year before last. -coneulibus
and noble, abl. abs. expressing the date.

ἓ 21. praeceps, hendrtrong3 mente captus, insana-haec
omnia, ie. the universe-rel publica (dat), against the State.
-ln aedem concordiem one of the principal temples at the
northern end of the Forum, where the Senate had held its session
on this day. lt was built by the consul L. Opimius, Β. c. 121, after
his bloody victory over C. Gracchus. One would almost think it a
piece of satire. ·

ς 22. quo: abl. of means (ξ 250. a.).—-sl dicam, uf J should
say (ς 307. b).-illa: the words in brackets are a manifest
gloss.

119, genn relates here to the Gauis as a whole, not to the
Allobroges in particulas-ultro, volumenta-patriciis: the
patricians were the original citizens of Rome; and the plebeiam, '
tlre mass, were their clients or dependants‚ foreign residents, and
emancipaied slaves. When the plebeians, after a contest of more
than a hundred years, obtained an equality of political rights, the
original patriciau familias still continued to be an bereditary aris·
tocracy‚ with no political privileges, but with the exclusive right tn
certain positions of mere honor and dignity, such as the princeps
