and ten days. He waS, however, so industrious and skilful in this,
that he returned in fifty days, thus completely foiling the next
plan of the¹ opposition, which was to bring on a trumped·up action
before the court, which should have precedence of that against
Verres, merely to consume time. ‘Cicero returned, with ample evi-
dence, even before his rival had left Italy. The trial was now fixed
for Aug. 5, uc. 70, in the consulship of Pompey and Crassus.
Meantime (in the latter part of July) the electione were held for
the next year, -as was the custom in Rome, several months before
the newly-elected magistrates entered upon their offices; the
successful candidate, under the title of designatus, enjoyed a dig-
nity almost equal to that of an actual magistrate, although with no
real power (see ch. ix.). In these elections Cicero was designated
aedile3 but his rival Hortensius was chosen consul, with Quintus
Metellus CreticuS, Verres' fast friend, as his colleague. More than
this, Marcus Metellus, brother of Quintus, was chosen praetor, and
the lot fell tohim to preside the next year in the court of Repetun-
dee. lf now the trial could be put over till the next year, when
Hortensius and the two Metelli would be in the three most influen-
tial positions in the State, Verres felt quite sure of getting clear.

Neither did it seem as if this would be very hard to bring about3 ¹

for the last six months of the Roman year were so full of festivals
and other days in which the courts could not sit, that the case would

be liable to constant interruptions and delays. This would have ¹

been a sore disappointment to Cicero, for, by good luck in drawing
the names, and sagacity in challenging, he had a jury that he could
trust, and he was not willing to run the risk of a change.

Under these circumstances Cicero made the second speech of the
Verrine group—that which is known as the Actio Prima, In this
he proved so conclusively the guilt of the defendant and his hope

to escape by bribery‚ and at the same time showed himself so de· ³

termined to urge the case through before the N ew Year, that he
hardly had any need to produce his witnesses. Hortensius soon
threw up his case, and Verres went into exile, with a name for ever
associated with extortion and misgovernment. F ull restitution of
the plunder was, however, not obtained: a compromise was made,
by which a less sum was paid in satisfaction of the claims. The
five speeches known as the “Accusati0n” (Actae Secunda) were
never delivered, but were written out and published in order to put
on record the facts which the orator had gethered with so much pains.
