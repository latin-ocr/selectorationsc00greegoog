The Roman state was developed out of the patriarchici state eteoclem of which it
retained many characteristic institutione, such as the patria potestas, the enormous
power, even of life and death. possessed hythe head ofa family (paterfamilias) over
those under his legal coenob-that is, all sons and descendants in the wertweard all

unmarried daughters. Daughters, upon their marriage, passed from the raama of the
father to that of the husband.

The gens was an enlaiged family, which had outgrown the centralized power of a
paterfamilias, and the feeling of near reruionship. but which still hold in theory to the
belief in a common descent, and which maintained a gentile organizatiom possessed certain
property in common, and kept up the observance of certain sacra. The chief object of
adoption (note, Sest.§ ι) was the maintenance of these sacra. lfa person died intes·
tate without nelis, his property went to his gens· The fundamental importanee of the gens
in the Roman patriarcha} institutione appears in the fact that the gentile nante, always
ending in ius (weept in a few Etruscan names in na, aa Perpenna) wasthe nornen proper,
while the family name was only cognomen Some persons, as C· Marius, had no family
name; but most genter fell into a number of families, and sometimes even these families
were divided into brancnes, with distinctive names. Thusthe Cornelian gem contained
the families of Scipio. Sulla, Cinna. Leontius, Dolabella, &c.; while a branch of the
Scipios retained for many generations the agmmen Nasica Strictly speaking, there were
no fully organized gentes except those of the patricianis, as the Cornelii, Julii, Fabii,
Claudii: but the plebeiae nohility (see note,verr.l.515)developed genus of its own,
which were quite analogous to those of the patriciana. Such were the Caecilii, Sempronii,
Licinii, Livii.
