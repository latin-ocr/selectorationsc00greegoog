seut-iuris, etc„ Clodius-vestro: i e. os the judices, men oi
senatorial and equestrian rank. -vooe ao sententia (hendiadys),
their loudly expressuri opinion-auspicia: as in the Roman polity
every action depended on the auspices, or expressed will os the
gods, forits validity‚ and the magistrates alone possessed the right
to look sor them (spectio), any magistrate possessing the auspices
could, unless prohibited by edict (see below), stop legislation by
announcing to the presiding magistrates unfavorable omens in the
sky (obnuntiare), or even, as it appears, by declaring bis intention
oi warching sor them. This means could be used even against the
comitio trulum,

The Senate and higher magistrates sometimes defended the passage oi their lawa honr
this interierence. by prohibiting any magistrate seruare de celo ou the day oi the cornuto ,·
and the whole process was regulated by the AEiian and Fuhan lawa (about n c. 1 yn). The
precise purport oi these laws is not known, but the present passage is one σι’ our principsl
suurees oi information in regard ιο them. Obnuntrirtrb was the sole means by which the
patrician mgistratee could omtrol the legislation oi the tubunas. This seems to have
been distinctly potin their hands by theAElian and Fufian lawe, and taken awayfrorn
them by the Clodran law, which also appears to have limited in some way the power ol
the tribunes to prevent legtstation by '‘interceding” (see note, Verr. 1. ς 44). Thus
Clodmswas relieved irom the interserente oi his oolleagues‚ as well as os the patricias
magistrates (consul, pretor. curule redte, and quaeror-so called, not aa being held by
patriciana exclusirely, which they were not, but as being oi patriciae origin).

intercederet, the technical word for the intersereuce (ueto) oi tbe
tribunes. - omnibus iestis diebus, on any legal business day.

The dr'es sorti were the days on which the praetor could hold his court: they were
the Ka'ends. Nones, and Ides of each monrh, together with the nundinae (day ha s-way
between ldes and Kalend), unless any oi these days were rendered unavailable by
re'igious services (see Momm. Rom. Chronp stol· They were therefore about sorty
in number. Other days were partiat y unarailable (dr‘er horret). On dr'es fasti, comitor
could not be huid: and the festival days in the Roman year were so numerous that there
remainei on'y about roo days in all ior the comatre. The Clodiam law seems to have
provided that the dier fasti should also he dr'er comuoles (see note, Verr. 1. 3¹)

lex stria, a law oi Q. AElius (cos. Β. c. 148) ; Fufia, of the tribune
F ufius; providing lor the above legal methods os delaying public
business. Both these laws were regarded as important saleguards
against hasty and partisan legislation.

ξ 13· pro tribunali, in frunt os the trt'bunal, a raised platiorm
or judgmentseat. The Aurelian tribunal was near the eastern end
ot' the F orum-nomine conlegiorum, see note, § ιι.

The associatione here spoken os are the calogo compitalicia, organisations whose
object was to conduct the sacred sites os the compita (crosa-ronds). The whole territory
was divided into districts. - pagi in the country. and uici in the city: and each district
hrd its local sacre. held m its central compitum. and addressed to its heres. or local
divinitus. The cot'egr'a wh'ch 'had charge os these. although nominahy relicinus, were
turned into ‘' street-clubsl’ under the control os pothouse politicians. They were “nothing
else than aformal organization -subdiv?ded according to streets. and with almost a mili-
tary arrangement-oi the whole free and slave proletariate oi the capital” (Momm).
'l'hese clubs were suppressed by the Sonare, u c· 64, and were now revived by Clodius, to
ard him in bis schemes.
