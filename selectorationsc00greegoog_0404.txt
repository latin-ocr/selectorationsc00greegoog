§to-98] Deserere os Milo. 125

-audlo, hear of ,⁰ iubenum, beor witness tn-propter me,
through my meana—bene moratam (ς 166. f), os good resou-
ners aud neorols.

§ 94. mibi (ᾖ ²32· a): for this passage, see Quint Vl. i. 27.
- tribunus, Sest 5 43. ·- dedissem, hod devoted. - acceperam,

206, § 95. quo videtis sc. eum esso.-otvibue,§ 235. -
plebem: this word, in the later republic, had lost its meaning oi a
class contrasted with the hereditary aristocracy of the patriciam,
and was applied to the lower classes in general-tribus patri-
moniis: Milo was by birth a member oi the Papian gens, but
was adopted (see note, Sest.§ 1) by his maternal grandfather, C.
Annius. This accounts ior two patrimonies; the third, Asconius
thinks, was probably his mother’s. The orator here makes a civic.
virtue out oi Milo’s lavish bethay-conciliant, has soon-sb·
laturum, will bear away, i. e. the memory of them.

§ 96. vocem praeconis, etc: ie the election was practically
decided, when the counitio were broken up by a mob. The electiori
could not therefore be formally and legally complete, and no an·
nouncement could be made by the herald-desiderarit, carad
sor. -iaoinoris suspitionem, etc: the suspicion of o great crime,
nottho indictment sor this oet. That is, as the last chapters
have shown, it was, in Cicero's view, not Clodius’s death, but sus·
picion oi designs against Pompey and the state, that decided the
case against Milo. -reoto tacta, § 207. e.

ἕ 97. si . . . ratio. ifregord is to be host. (The proper apo-
dosis roe should say, doc, is supplanted by the thing that would
be said3 and by this protasis and apodosis the tense os the rest
ol the paragraph is changed.)

207. ξ 98. noune testes: holidays appointed by the people
of Etruria, the neighbors whom Clodius had cheated and robbed,
at the good news oi his death—et actos et institutos, in app.
with festos: the celebrations that have already taken place, and
the anniversaries that have been established. — centesima et
altera i. e. just one hundred days.

Τὴε length oi interval was caused by the insertion this year ol sn intercalary month
between Febmary and March. This was in theory done every other year. but was
practically lest to the eepdce oi the pontifices, from which it resulted that the calendar
had fallen into extreme connsion. The calendar year was 67 days behind the true time:
and the discrepancyremained until the retonn by Julius Caesar, a. c. 45. The Roman
year at this time consisted of only ³⁵⁵ days, and the interval was alternately of ιο and 22
days (see ξ 376) These we··e inserted, not at the end of February, but alternately aiter
the auth and 23d os the month. so that the intercalary mouth (Mercedoniusl always con-
tained ²7 days (Momm Rbus. Chr. p. ar). According to Asconius, the trial voss aprile

disputed. Counting ior January rr days, the Mensis Intercatarts ²7· March 3¹· and
