§¹8·2⁶·] Irizpeockment of Verres. 27

Metellus was so great, that he did not even yet see through the
tricks of the defence. - certis, trusty. -seperiebamz the imperf·
denotes a succession of items of information-necos, wicker
bosleni, used for carrying money. The word came to mean ireos-
ure-cnse, or private treasury; and, ,when the empire was established,
it was applied to the einperor's privy-purse. Hence the word fiscol.
-Sioilienee‚ i. e. that extorted in Sicily-senatore, etc. The
senator, a man oi the same class as Verres, put the money to be
used in the electioris and trial into the hands of an eques, one of
the class that had the management of all such financial operations.
He retained, however, say (quasi) ten basketS, to be used directly
to defeat Cicero's election to the aedileship. —nomine, on account
ofi - divisores, managers. The money to be used at electioris was
put into the hands of sequestres (election agents), who themselves
made use of divisores to approach the voters personally. On this
occasion, the exigency was so great that Verres himself (istum)
called the divisores to his house, without the mediation of se-
questres.

θη. omnia debere, was mund to do any thing for me.—
proximis, tlte last—negasse audere, said they did not dore.—
iortem, stenen (ironical)‚ in allusion to audere-Romilia, sc.
tribu. -ex optima disciplina, from tlte best school (ironical)‚ ie.
that of Verres' father. —H S. (see §377-380): the defeat of Cicero
would, therefore, cost about 025000, which the purchasing power
ot money made full twice as valuable then as now.

ξ 24. A lively description of the embarrassment in which Cicero
was placed at the end of July by the election and the trial, both
coming on together.-agere deterrebar, l was deterreri from
doing (§ 271. ‹zi-petitioni, cannam-ratio, my policy.

· flatum esse, tholornessogewossent. This compound impliesa
peremptory and threatening message.-primum corresponds to
acessit, etc.. 5 27. -eane liberos, quin free, i. ein refusing to
come. lf he had been consul, instead of merely consul-elect, they
would have had to come—oursare, run ln'tlzer arrd liuline.—
appellare et convenire, oecost undgreet.

§ 26. M. Metellum (see 5 21), the friend of Verres, who had
obtained the presidency of the court of Repetnndoe for the next
year.—eo, tiis thing, i. e. postponing the trial—praerogativam,
indication. In the comitia centurione, it was determined by lot
which century should first cast its vote. The vote of this century,
called prerogotiva (prae-rogo), was regarded as an onien, and was
likely to decide the result. The prerogotiva which Q. Metellus ·
gave to Verres, in return sor the prerogativae of the comitia, is

described in the next section.
