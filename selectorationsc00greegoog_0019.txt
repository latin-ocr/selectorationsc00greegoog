x Lesa of Cicero.

devoting himself to his private studies. He appears to have
welcomed the triumph of Sulla (s. c. 82) as an earnest of
order and good government; but was soon disgusted with
the despotic rule of the dictator, and placed himself in that
attitude of moderate opposition to the oligarchy to which
he was, on the whole, faithful through life. No person
dared oppose Sulla in any political measure; but in the
administration of justice even the tyrant was obliged,for
deceney’s sake, to listen to words of truth and boldness.
The defence of Roscius, Cicero’s first public oration (Β. e.
80), may rank, in a political point of view, with Erslrine’e
defence of Hardy, or the genereuseloquence of the advocate
Berryer in the time of Napoleon III. Of its results the
orator himself says, that ‘⁶ it received such commendation,
that there was no case which did not seem worthy of nis

After this brilliant success, Cicero spent two years 'in
travel and study in Greeee and Asia. Then returning to
Rome, he held (Β. e. 75) the office of Quaestor‚ which made
him a member of the Senate. This office he exercised in

broke out afresh. A democratia agitation began, which
continued steadily increasing‚ till it culminated thirty years ·
later in another civil war. Sulla's aristocratic constitution
was repealed in the consulship of Pompey and Crassus
(a. e. 70), by the restoring of judicial power to the middle
class (equites). In this year Cicero conducted the cele·
brated impeachment of VerreS, in which he gained the
signal success of forcing that corrupt err-magistrate into
exile, without waiting the result of the trial. The legislation
of this year identified Pompey with the popular party; and
Cicero attached himself to the interests of that ambitione
and successful general, giving him timely aid-in the
speech for the Manilian Law -in obtaining the command
against Mithridates in the East. The same year (s. e. 66)
Cicero held the praetorship, having been curule aedile three
