of L. Lucullus-quaestionibus habitis: this relates to the con·
silium of relatives, held by the paterfamilias, or head of the
family, to pass judgment upon crimes iu the family—civem

Galatian Brogitarus, sunnin-law of King Deiotarus, was compli· ,

mented with the title of king bya law of Clodius—ademit, re-
ferring to the case of King Ptolemyof Cyprus, spoken ofin the
oration for Sestius-partitus est: see Sest.§ 10.-eivem:
this is usually referred to Pompey. But, though Pompey was
attacked by Clodius (see ξ 18), there was no bloodshed: further,
singulari virtute et gloria is a mild expression for Cicero to use
of Pompey on this occasion, and, though it is rather exaggerated
ior the tribune F abricius (see ξ 38), yet the circumstances precisely
correspond. - aedem Nympharum, containing the censorial regis·
ters. It appears to have been burnt iu the disorders which pre-
ceded Cicero's exile.

ς 74 non calumniantium: fraudulent and malicious lawsuits
were too mild and dilatory a method of plunder. A powerful noble,
with his slaves and clients‚ had almost an army at his disposal,
and in the disorders of the present time this actually amounted
to private variare, like that of the feudal nobles. The following
incidents illustrate this furtlrer.-eacramentls: a form of pro-
cedure in which a penalty or forfeit (sacramentum) was deposited
by esch party to abide the result of the suit. -Etrusoon see

-iratrem2 Ap. Claudius Pulcher, an elder brother of Clodius,
Cicero's predecessor in the province of Cilicia—Appium: the
oration for Sestius shows that App. Claudius was not always on
the best terms with the aristocracy3 in fact. the Claudii were as a
family characterized by original and radical opinions (see Momm.
Rom. F orsch i. p. 285).—dejeeit, ‹vristad-vestibulum, court·
yard, or open space in front of the house-sororis, probably
his second sister, wife of Q. Metellus Celer, who lived next her
brother on the Palatine.
