st quis attulerst . . . mennas, ef any would proposes would

iu alh-cui, interrogative—ut non, etc, without his being
called, dcc, even though, &c..-cleoernenda nou fuit, ought not
to have been woted.

ξ 12. an . . . adimemus, shall wo theu depriue f-appeiiaret
would have styled (imperf. because of repeated action).—quae
increbuit: in the later days of the republic, the title of imperator
and the honor of triumph were granted upon much less cause than
in earlier times-—ovantemz the ouah'o was an inferior triumph,
sometimes granted by the Senate, in cases when the proportions
or circumstances of the victory, or the rank of the commander, did
not warrant the supreme honor of a triumph (see note, Man. ἕ 8).
The general did not wear the purple embroidered robe, or the laurei
crown, but the ordinary toga pretextu, and a wreath of myrtle.

§ ιιι Parilibus: the Parilia or Polilu (April 21) was one of
the most ancient Roman festivals, inhonoros Pales, a goddess
of flocks. This day was regarded as the anniversary of the found·
ing of the city-qui dies, etc, which occur this very day.—
eum lucibus descensurum, was coming down with the insignia
of usurped power. -hoe ease conlatum, this [intention] was
uttre'buted- ne quid, § 319. a.- [ut]:i rfthis word' is retained,
the expression is subj of exclam. (ᾖ 332· b); if omitted, a rhe-
torical question (ξ 268). —exsisherem etc, should turn out os
u sudden another Catilina (imperf. as referring back to the time
when his enemies said “descendet.”)-quibus auspiciis, i. e. by
what formal authority. -augun I au augur (emphatic): i. e. an
augur would know his science too well for such an attempt. This
was the latest of Cicero's official honors, received ten years before3
and he fully appreciates the dignity of the priestly craft.

While an augur had the power of interpreting the auspices, only magistrates had the
power oi taking them (see note, Cat. 1v. alt and augure were not in any sense magis·
nuos sooner, any assumption of power would be invalid unless confirmed by auspices
Cicero, though an augur, was unable to take the first preliminary step to any usurpation
oi power. A technical obstacle like this would not stand long in the way oia modern
usurpem but the stress here laid upon it ilustrates the degree in which the pecuhm for-
malism of the Roman religion had become worked into the Roman mind3 and further,
the power exeret 'sed by this adherence to fcsrm' m protecting the institutione of the State.

traderem: the imperium, as well as the auspicia, descended
by regular succession, like ecelesiastical functions' m the church.
-quemquamne futen, ξ 274. -eermo, mere talk, not even
honest suspicion.
